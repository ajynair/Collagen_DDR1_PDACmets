Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly desmoplastic, aggressive cancer that frequently progresses and spreads by liver metastasis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), extracellular matrix (ECM), and type I collagen (Col I) support or restrain PDAC progression and may impede blood supply and nutrient availability. The dichotomous role of the stroma in PDAC, and the mechanisms through which it influences patient survival and enables desmoplastic cancers escape nutrient limitation remain poorly understood. This paper showed that matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-cleaved or intact Col I exert opposing effects on PDAC bioenergetics, macropinocytosis (MP), tumor growth and liver metastasis. The scRNA-seq analyses were performed in human datasets of 5 primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and 1 liver-metastasis samples from GSE156405.
